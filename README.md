# Team Task Tracking Tool



# Team Task Project

When we work as a team we usually end up identifying activities which needs to be done on repeating basis. These activities needs to be tracked and ensured that we complete them on time.

In the following labs we will be building a team task tracking tool. This tool dynamically creates  weekly, monthly and yearly  tasks based on metadata. 

This project can help you track those items and ensure all team members act on customer specific actions and Yearly Goals on regular basis.

So if you are working in a team which needs to carry out certain tasks in regular interval, this will be a good starting point.

Also, it will help you understand how easy it is to create an application using Amplify in less than an hour. You would learn about Amplify's capabilities to help you integrate with Appsync with Dynamodb, cloudfront, s3 and cognito


We would be using following architecture to develop this tool
